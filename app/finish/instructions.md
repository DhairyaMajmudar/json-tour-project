<h2><center>Congratulations ðŸ¥³</center></h2>

Congratulations!!! We have so far completed understanding the creating schema definations and defining an array of type number.

A summary of two chapters can be found read below :)

## Chapter 1: JSON Schema introduction and creating schema definations

In this chapter we learned about what JSON Schema is and what are its use cases. Along with that we have also learned about how to create schema definations and using keywords like `$schema`,`$id`, `description` and `title`.

We also did hands on practise on the code editor while validating it with the sample schema data.

## Chapter 2: Arrays and type keyword in it.

Array data structure is very useful to store elements in order. In this chapter we have larned about defining an array of type number with the help of keywords `items` and `type` useful for defining the type of elements in the array.

As of next you can explore the docs from the [link](https://json-schema.org/overview/what-is-jsonschema#next-steps). Also one can explore the JSON Schema [Website](https://json-schema.org)
